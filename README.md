## User Guide

### Track Focus Time

Every time you open a note, the plugin automatically starts tracking your focus time, which is displayed in the status bar at the bottom right. When you switch notes or minimize Obsidian, the plugin stops tracking and saves the data (you can disable window detection in the plugin settings by turning off focus mode).
